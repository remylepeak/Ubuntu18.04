# My Setup

For the purposes of "infecting" an Ubuntu18.04 VM, I set up two separate VMs. One of these would be the host, which acted as the attacker in this scenario. The other VM, which is the one publicly available to download, acted as the target/victim. For reference, both of these VMs use the Ubuntu18.04 OS.

For the purposes of testing this Virtual Machine, one does not need to set up multiple VMs. I only created more than one as a means of infecting, as explained above. It is certainly possible to create your own network of Machines and this publicly available one to said group.&#x20;
