# ðŸ–¥ VirtualBox

In order to host a Virtual Machine, we will be using Virtual Box.&#x20;

This software is straightforward but also popular amongst users because it has the ability to be cross-platform. Make your way over to the VirtualBox release page and find your OS-related package. This project was created using a Windows PC, for reference.&#x20;

VirtualBox has a quick and easy executable that will install on whichever OS you prefer.&#x20;
