Velociraptor has many different ways to collect digital forensic data&#x20;

* Hunt Manager
* Server Artifacts
* Server Events
* Notebooks
* Other options that come with a full Configuration

### Hunt Manager

Don't wait until an event occurs. With the hunt manager, you can actively search for suspicious activities using our library of forensic artifacts, then customize it to your specific threat-hunting needs.

### Server Artifacts

These are structured like YAML files and contain a query and a name attached to that query. This allows an investigator to search for a query by its name or description and simply run the query on the endpoint rather than needing to type the query into the UI.

### Server Events

Additional Server events can be added to the main dashboard.

This combines Artifacts that have been created and will add them to the dashboard once configured properly.

### Notebooks

These are interactive collaborative documents, which are tied to VQL, the language that is central to the functionality of Velociraptor.

### Additional Modes

* Host Information
* Virtual Filesystem
* Client Events
